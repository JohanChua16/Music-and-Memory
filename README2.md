# Predicting Alcoholic Status
This repository contains the data and analysis for a final project I completed for a Data Mining and Machine Learning course. It includes six data files (.csv file), the relevant code (.Rmd file), a PDF version of the final report and a PDF version of the report's corresponding slide deck. 

In this project, we built various machine learning classification models to predict alcoholic status of individuals using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Key features of this project include: 

- The imputation of missing values within the dataset using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE Library) and Multiple Imputation using Additive Regression, Bootstrapping, and Predictive Mean Matching (Hmisc Library).

- The creation of ML Classification models, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, LDA, QDA, Recursive Partitioning & Decision Trees, XGBoost, and GBM.
